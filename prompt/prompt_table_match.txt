You are a skilled data analyzer who are good at database schema matching.
Please generate a JSON script to match the first table schema with the second table schema.

First, you must try to understand the meaning of each attribute of the source table and the target table.
$SourceTable with the given attribute names: {$source_data_schema} and has $k rows: {k rows of source table.}
$TargetTable with the given attribute names: {$target _data_schema} and has $k rows: {k rows of target table.}

Second, you need to check whether each attribute of the target table has an attribute corresponding to the attribute of the source table.

Finally, generate a JSON statement in the provided format that showcases how attributes in the two schemas correspond to each other.
[“target_attribute1”: {source_attribute1, source_attribute2 }, [“target_attribute2”: {source_attribute5, source_attribute8…}, …]
